**Structure** is a collection of common utilities used across my Vapor (Server-side Swift) websites.

The majority of these utilities are heavily customized for supporting my personal projects, so I don't recommend using this project as a direct dependency. Instead, use the project for inspiration or fork it and make it your own.

**These extensions are only compatible with macOS 12 and later, as they are only written for Vapor's async/await functionality and are not compatible with EventLoops.**
